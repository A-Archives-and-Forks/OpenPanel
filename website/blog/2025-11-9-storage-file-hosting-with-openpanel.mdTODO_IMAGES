OpenPanel makes it easy to create hosting plans dedicated purely to file storage. With these plans, users have access only to **File Manager** and **FTP**, allowing them to manage files remotely—for example, for backups—without full website hosting access.

## Setting Up Storage-Only Hosting Plans

OpenPanel allows you to define feature sets per plan, so you can quickly create **files-only hosting plans**. The setup involves three main steps: enabling modules, creating a feature set, and assigning it to hosting plans.

---

### Step 1: Enable Required Modules

Navigate to **OpenAdmin > Settings > Modules** and enable the modules necessary for file storage hosting:

* **File Manager** – Manage files and backups
* **FTP** – Create and manage FTP accounts
