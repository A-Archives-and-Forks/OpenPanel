### Why We’re Making This Change
As technology evolves and the demands on server management grow, so too does our commitment to delivering cutting-edge tools, top-tier support, and continuous improvements to our platform. With new updates and enhancements, the cost of maintaining, developing, and supporting OpenPanel has increased.

In the last 6 months we added:

- Support for [Debian](https://openpanel.com/blog/openpanel-supports-debian12/), [AlmaLinux, RockyLinux, Fedora, CentOS](https://openpanel.com/blog/openpanel-rhel-support/)
- Support for MariaDB
- [FTP interface](https://openpanel.com/docs/changelog/0.2.9/#-new-features) and [Email support](https://community.openpanel.com/d/91-email-support-for-openpanel-enterprise-edition)
- [Import cPanel accounts](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/transfers/import-cpanel-backup-to-openpanel/)
- [Support for ConfigServer Firewall](https://openpanel.com/docs/changelog/0.2.3/#configserver-firewall)
- [WHMCS](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/extensions/openpanel-and-whmcs/) and [FOSSBilling integration](https://openpanel.com/docs/articles/extensions/openpanel-and-fossbilling/)
- [100+ cli commands](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/)
- [20+ api endpoints](https://dev.openpanel.com/api/)


Here are a few reasons why we’re adjusting our pricing:

- Ongoing Development and New Features
We’re constantly rolling out new features to enhance functionality, security, and usability. Recent additions, like advanced monitoring tools, enhanced security modules, and cloud integrations, are designed to meet the evolving needs of our users.

Security remains at the forefront of what we do. Our team dedicates significant resources to ensuring OpenPanel Enterprise is equipped with the latest security protocols, safeguarding your data and infrastructure from threats.

- Improved Customer Support
We’ve expanded our support team to offer even faster response times and deeper expertise, ensuring that your technical questions and issues are resolved promptly and professionally.

- Infrastructure Upgrades
To keep up with the increasing load and ensure our platform runs smoothly at scale, we've invested in infrastructure improvements that will benefit all OpenPanel Enterprise users.

### What’s Changing?
Starting on 31. December 2024, the price of OpenPanel Enterprise will increase from 14.95€ per month to 24.95€ per month. This change will apply to new purchases and **not to subscription renewals**.

### How Will This Affect Current Users?
For existing OpenPanel Enterprise users, any subscription renewals will continue at the current rate of 14.95€ per month.

We understand that price changes can be unexpected, but we believe that the value we continue to deliver with OpenPanel Enterprise is unmatched.
