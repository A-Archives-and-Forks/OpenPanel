Ezeelogin 7.37.11 supports auto-login to OpenPanel servers!

<!--truncate-->

We've been relying on [Ezeelogin](https://www.ezeelogin.com/) since 2014 as our SSH Jump Server solution for managing access to Linux hosts, including control panels like cPanel and CyberPanel. However, we encountered issues with auto-login for OpenPanel due to overlapping port usage (2083 and 2087) with cPanel, causing session cookie conflicts.

After contacting Ezeelogin support, they promptly addressed the issue and introduced support for OpenPanel in [Ezeelogin version 7.37.11](https://www.ezeelogin.com/user_manual/ChangeLog.html) ðŸŽ‰

A big thank you to the Ezeelogin team for enabling support for OpenPanel!
