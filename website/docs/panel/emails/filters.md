# Manage Filters

OpenPanel (specifically Dovecot) uses [Sieve](http://sieve.info/) to filter email messages.

Navigate to **OpenPanel > Emails > Manage Filters** to create and manage filter scripts for your email accounts.

1. Select the email address to manage filters for.  
2. In the **Current Filters** section, configure your desired rules by inserting or editing the Sieve script.  
3. Click **Save Filter** to apply the changes.
