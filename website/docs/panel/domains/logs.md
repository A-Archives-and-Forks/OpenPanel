# Raw Access Logs

The **Raw Access Logs** feature is available in your OpenPanel dashboard only if the **Domain Logs** module is enabled on the server and your user account has the necessary permissions.

From the **Domain Logs** page, you can view raw access logs generated by the **Caddy** web server for your domain.

Caddy is used to manage SSL, handle proxy configurations, and forward traffic to your containerized services (e.g., Varnish, Nginx, OpenResty, Apache).

Each log entry contains detailed information, including:

* **Timestamp** – The exact time of the request
* **Client IP** – The IP address from which the request originated
* **Log Level** – Log severity (e.g., info, warning, error)
* **HTTP Method** – Request method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
* **Status Code** – HTTP response code (200, 301, 403, 500, etc.)
* **URI** – The requested path
* **Logger** – Internal Caddy logger identifier
* **Message** – Details about the request handling or errors
* **Size** – Request size in bytes
* **Duration** – Time taken by Caddy to process and forward the request to your web server

By default, 1,000 results are shown per page. This limit is configurable by the server administrator.
