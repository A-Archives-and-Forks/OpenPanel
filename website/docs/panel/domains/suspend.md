# Suspend a domain

You can temporarily suspend a domain from the **Domains** page. When a domain is suspended, its website content is replaced with a *Suspended Website* page, as configured by the Administrator.

This feature is useful for quickly disabling a website while keeping all other servicesâ€”such as email, FTP, and more - fully functional.
