# Redirects

If the **Domain Redirects** feature is enabled, you can create and manage domain-level redirects from the Domains page.

For each domain, you can specify a destination URL to redirect traffic to. The URL must begin with `http://` or `https://`. All traffic to the domain will be redirected to this URL *before* reaching your web server.
