# Unsuspend a domain

To restore access to a suspended website, you can unsuspend the domain from the **Domains** page.

Unsuspending a domain will remove the *Suspended Website* page and restore the original website content, making it publicly accessible again. All other services - such as email and FTP - will continue to function as they did during suspension.
