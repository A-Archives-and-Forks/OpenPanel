# GoAccess

OpenPanel integrates [GoAccess](https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess), a powerful open-source log analyzer, to provide detailed visual traffic reports for each domain.

The **GoAccess** feature is available in your OpenPanel dashboard only if the **GoAccess module** is enabled on the server and your account has permission to access it.

Each domain has its own individual report. To view the report for a specific domain, simply choose it from the dropdown menu on the GoAccess page. A new tab will open in your browser displaying the analytics report.

Reports are generated daily by default, but this frequency can be customized by the server administrator. You can check the last refresh time in the top-right corner of the report page.
