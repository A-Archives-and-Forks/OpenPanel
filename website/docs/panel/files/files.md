# File Manager 

The **File Manager** interface allows you to manage files for all your domains located inside the `/var/www/html/` directory.

In the table, you can see the following information:

* **Name**
* **Size** – Displays the size for files. For folders, click **Calculate** to fetch their size.
* **Last Modified** – Shows the timestamp of the last modification.
* **Permissions** – Displays symbolic file permissions (e.g., `drwxr-xr-x`). Hover over them to view the octal (numeric) equivalent (e.g., `0755`).

Clicking the **Toggle** icon reveals additional details:

* **Owner** – The UID of the file or folder owner.
* **Group** – The GID of the group that owns the file or folder.
* **Links** – The number of hard links to the file or directory.
* **Link Target** – If it’s a symlink, this shows the target it points to.
* **Type** – Indicates whether it's a directory, file, or symbolic link.


## Create File

To create a new file, navigate to the desired directory and click the **New File** button. In the modal, enter the filename and click **Create**.

Optionally, if you want to open the file in the Editor immediately after creation, check the **Open in File Editor after creation** option.

## Create Folder

To create a new folder, navigate to the desired directory and click the **New Folder** button. In the modal, enter the folder name and click **Create**.

## Upload Files

The File Manager allows you to upload multiple files at once. You can upload files using one of the following methods:

- **Drag&Drop in File Manager**: Navigate to the desired folder and drag and drop files into the file list table.
- **Upload from device**: Click the 'Upload' button, then drag and drop or select files from your device on the new page.
- **Download from URL**: Click 'Download from URL instead', then enter the link to the file you want to download.

Upload size limits are configurable by the Administrator.


## Select all

Use your mouse cursor to select multiple files and folders. Click and drag, then click again to release the selection.

To select multiple files, one by one, click and hold `Ctrl` key while clicking on the rows.

To select all files in the directory at once, click on the 'Select All' button. To deselect all files, click on the 'Deselect' button.


## Delete

To delete files or folders click on the 'Delete' button. If multiple files or folders are selected, you will see the list in the modal and click 'Delete' to permanently delete the selected files.

:::danger
OpenPanel FileManager does not utilize a separate Trash folder where files are temporarily moved and can later be restored from, similar to the Recycle Bin on your computer system. If you delete files using the delete option, they are permanently deleted immediately and cannot be recovered. Please exercise caution when using the delete function.

## Download File

To download a file, click on the **Download** button when the file is selected.

:::info
Downloading multiple files at once is not supported. Instead, the 'Compress' option should be used to create an archive of files, and then download that archive.
