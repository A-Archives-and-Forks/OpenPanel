# Malware Scanner

The **Malware Scanner** feature is available in your OpenPanel dashboard only if **ClamAV** is enabled on the server and your account has permission to use it.

## Manual Scan

To perform a manual scan, select the path you want to scan and click the **Start Scan** button.

ClamAV will check the files one by one and display the results for each.

## Automatic Scan

Automatic scans are configured by the server administrator. If enabled, scan results will appear on this page, along with a **Quarantine** section where you can view and manage infected files.
