# Upload from Device

The **Upload from Device** page allows you to easily upload files from your local device to a selected directory on the server.

To upload:

1. Navigate to the desired directory.
2. Click the **Upload** button.
3. Drag and drop files or select them manually from your device.
4. Click **Upload** to begin.

A progress bar will display the status of each file. You can upload multiple files at once.

> ⚠️ The upload size limit is configured by the administrator.

For large files (over 1GB), we recommend using **FTP** or the **Download from URL** feature instead.
