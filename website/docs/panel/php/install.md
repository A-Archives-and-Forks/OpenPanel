# Install New PHP Version  

Select a PHP version to install on your system. Available versions are fetched from the official PHP repositories, ensuring new releases are available immediately.  

Once a version is selected, the installation process runs in the background and typically takes 3-5 minutes. A live installation log is displayed on the same page for progress tracking.  

In addition to the PHP version, all administrator-specified extensions are installed automatically.
