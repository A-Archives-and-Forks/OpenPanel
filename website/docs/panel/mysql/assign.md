# Assign User to DB

Assign a MySQL user to an existing database to grant permissions for executing queries, modifying tables, and managing data.

This is a critical step after creating a database and user - without it, the user won't be able to interact with the database.

To assign an existing user to a database, navigate to **OpenPanel > MySQL > Assign User to DB**:

1. **Select a User**  
   Choose the MySQL user you want to grant access to.

2. **Select a Database**  
   Choose the existing database the user should be assigned to.

3. **Click 'Assign User to Database'**  
   After selecting both user and database, click the **Assign User to Database** button.  
   The user will be granted **all privileges** on the selected database.
