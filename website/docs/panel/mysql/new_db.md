Navigate to **OpenPanel > MySQL > Create Database**:

1. **Enter a Database Name**

2. **Generate a Random Name** *(Optional)*  
   If you're unsure about a name, click the button next to the input field to automatically generate a secure and unique database name.

3. **Click 'Create Database'**  
   Once the name is entered or generated, click the **Create Database** button to initialize your new MySQL database.

## Best Practices

- Use short and descriptive names (e.g., `app_data`, `wordpress_db`).
- Avoid using uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.
- Make sure the database name is meaningful for easy identification later.
