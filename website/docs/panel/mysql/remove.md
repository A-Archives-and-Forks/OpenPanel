# Remove User from DB

Remove a MySQL user from an existing database to revoke their permissions and prevent access to execute queries, modify tables, or manage data.

This step is essential for managing access control and ensuring that only authorized users can interact with sensitive or production data.

To remove user access from a database, navigate to **OpenPanel > MySQL > Remove User from DB**:

1. **Select a User**  
   Choose the MySQL user whose access you want to revoke.

2. **Select a Database**  
   Choose the database from which the user should be removed.

3. **Click 'Remove User from Database'**  
   After selecting both the user and the database, click the **Remove User from Database** button.  
   The user will immediately lose **all privileges** on the selected database.
