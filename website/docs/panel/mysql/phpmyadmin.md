Editing and manipulating tables directly from phpMyAdmin could break your site if not done correctly. If you are not comfortable doing this, please check with a developer first.

Once youâ€™re logged in to phpMyAdmin, you can view your database tables, run queries, drop tables, import data, export your WordPress database, and more.
