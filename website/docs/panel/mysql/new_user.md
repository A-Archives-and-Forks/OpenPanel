# Create User

Easily create a new MySQL user in just a few clicks. Users are used for interacting with databases or the MySQL server.

Navigate to **OpenPanel > MySQL > Create User**:

1. **Enter a Username**  
   Type your desired username into the input field. Make sure the name is unique and follows MySQL naming rules (e.g., avoid spaces or special characters).

2. **Enter a Password**  
   Type your desired password in the second input field. To generate a strong random password, click the button next to the input field.

3. **Click 'Create User'**  
   Once you enter or generate username and password, click the **Create User** button to create your new MySQL user.

## Best Practices

- Use short and descriptive names (e.g., `app_data`, `wordpress_db`).
- Avoid using uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.
- Make sure the username name is meaningful for easy identification later.
