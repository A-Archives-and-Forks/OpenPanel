# Modules


Modules (also known as plugins) enhance the OpenPanel UI by adding new features and pages. To make a feature available to a user or plan, it must first be enabled as a module.

Modules are loaded when the OpenPanel UI starts. A service restart is required to apply any newly added modules.
