# OpenPanel

![openadmin openpanel settings](/img/admin/adminpanel_openpanel_settings.png)

The OpenPanel Settings page allows you to edit settings and features available to users in their OpenPanel interface.

## Branding

To set a custom name visible in the OpenPanel sidebar and on login pages, enter the desired name in the "Brand name" option. Alternatively, to display a logo instead, provide the URL in the "Logo image" field and save the changes.

## Set nameservers

Before adding any domains its important to first create nameservers so that added domains will have valid dns zone files and be able to propagate.

Configuring nameservers involves two steps:

1. Create private nameservers (glue DNS records) for the domain through your domain registry.
2. Add the nameservers into the OpenPanel configuration.

Here are tutorials for some popular domain providers:
- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/additional-options/custom-nameservers/zone-custom-nameservers/)
- [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/help/add-custom-hostnames-12320)
- [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/768/10/how-do-i-register-personal-nameservers-for-my-domain/#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20Manage%20option,5.)

To add nameservers from OpenAdmin navgiate to Settings > OpenPanel and set nameservers in ns1 and ns2 fields and click on save:

![openpanel add nameservers](/img/admin/openadmin_add_ns.png)

Or from terminal run commands:
```bash
opencli config update ns1 your_ns1.domain.com
opencli config update ns2 your_ns2.domain.com
```

:::info
After creating nameservers it can take up to 12h for the records to be globally accessible. Use a tool sush as [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to monitor the status.

If you still experience problems after the propagation process, then please check this guide: [dns server not responding to reqeuests](https://community.openpanel.co/d/5-dns-server-does-not-respond-to-request-for-domain-zone).

## Enable Features

Administrators have the ability to enable or disable each feature (page) in the OpenPanel interface. To activate a feature, select it in the "Enable Features" section and click save. The change is immediate and restarts OpenPanel service.

Once enabled, the feature becomes instantly available to all users, appearing in the OpenPanel interface sidebar, search results, and dashboard icons.
