# Update Preferences


The Update Preferences section provides the option to enable or disable Auto updates and Auto patches. Patches involve minor updates aimed at fixing bugs without introducing new features. On the other hand, Updates encompass major updates that introduce new features, potentially impacting existing functionality.
