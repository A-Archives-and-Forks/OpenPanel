# API Access

Use the API Access section to interact with the OpenPanel API directly from your dashboard. This tool allows you to test API calls, view request/response examples, monitor API logs, and experiment with endpoints in a simple interface.

To begin:

1. **Enable API Access**
Toggle the Enable API Access option to activate the interface for testing API requests.

2. **Fill the Request Form**
Once enabled, you will see a form with the following fields:

- **GET** – Choose the HTTP method (currently supports GET).

- **URL** – Enter the API endpoint you wish to call.

- **TOKEN** – Paste your authentication token for authorization.

- **DATA** – (Optional) Provide any data or parameters required by the endpoint.

3. Send Request
Click the Send Request button to execute the API call.

5. View API Logs and Curl command
After making a request, the response, curl command and log details will appear at the bottom. This includes request info, server response, status codes, and any error messages.
