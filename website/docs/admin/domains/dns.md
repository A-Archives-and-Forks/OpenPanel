# DNS Zone Editor

Edit the DNS zone for any domain hosted on the server.

1. Navigate to **OpenAdmin > Domains > DNS Zone Editor**.
2. Select the domain whose zone you want to edit.
3. Make your changes in the editor and click **Save** when done.

The DNS zone is reloaded immediately, and propagation begins.  
> ⚠️ If there are syntax errors, the zone file will be excluded.  
> ✅ Always create a backup before making changes and validate the file to avoid misconfiguration.
