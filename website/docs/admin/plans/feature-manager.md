# Feature Manager

The Feature Manager allows administrators to enable or disable specific features (pages) within the OpenPanel UI. This is useful for customizing the control panel experience based on user roles, security policies, or hosting plans.

Each feature can be toggled individually via the interface. Once activated, the feature becomes visible and accessible to all users. Deactivating a feature hides it from the panel and disables its functionality.

## Use Cases

**Feature Sets** are used to control which UI features users can access based on their assigned hosting package. This allows for clear separation between user types and service levels.

### Example 1: Database-Only Plans

Create a feature set named **"MySQL Only"** and enable only MySQL-related features within it.
Assign this feature set to all database-focused hosting packages. For instance:

* One package allows up to **10 databases**.
* Another package allows **unlimited databases** (`0` for no limit).

Despite the difference in limits, all users under these plans will see **only MySQL-related pages** in the UI.

### Example 2: Beginner vs. Advanced Users

Create two separate feature sets:

* **Advanced Users Set**:
  Enable features like **Docker** and **PHP.INI Editor** to give experienced users full controlâ€”such as setting custom resource limits, restarting services, etc.

* **Beginner Users Set**:
  Do **not** enable advanced features. Instead, allow access to a **PHP selector** with limited options. This keeps the UI simple and safe for users with minimal technical experience.


## Feature not showing?

Features are accessible to users only if the corresponding **Module** is active. Modules control which OpenPanel features are available, while **Feature Sets** determine access based on the user's hosting package.

For example, adding the "Docker" feature to a plan does **not** grant access to the Docker (Containers) pages in the UI unless the **Docker module** is also activated under **OpenAdmin > Settings > Modules**.
