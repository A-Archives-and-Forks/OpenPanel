## Start

To start the Imunify graphical interface, use:

```bash
opencli imunify start
```

## Login

Access the Imunify GUI from **OpenAdmin > Security > Imunify** using your SSH credentials (typically the `root` username and its password).

## Manage

Imunify allows you to scan user files and detect any malicious content.
