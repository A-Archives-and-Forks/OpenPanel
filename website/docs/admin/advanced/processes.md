# Process Manager

The Process Manager allows you to view and manage running system processes directly from the OpenPanel interface. It's a powerful tool for monitoring system activity and taking quick action when needed.

The process table includes the following details:

- **PID** – Process ID. Options are available to trace the process or kill it directly.

- **Owner** – The user that owns the process.

- **Priority** – The process's current scheduling priority.

- **CPU** – Percentage of CPU usage.

- **Memory** – Percentage of Memory usage.

- **Command** – The command or service that launched the process.

Use this tool to identify resource-heavy or suspicious processes, manage system load, or terminate unresponsive services.
