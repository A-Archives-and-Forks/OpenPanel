# Change Root Password

Use this section to securely update the SSH password for the root user.

To ensure strong security, your new password must meet the following requirements:

- Length: 8â€“20 characters

- Must include both letters and numbers

- No spaces, special characters, or emoji are allowed

This action updates the root user's credentials used for direct SSH access to the server. Always store your new password securely and avoid using easily guessable combinations.
