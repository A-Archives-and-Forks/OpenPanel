Released on February 07, 2025

### 🚀 Breaking changes
- **Custom Document Roots**: Users can now set custom document root when adding new domains.
- **Redesigned UI**: The user interface now uses Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js instead of Bootstrap, resulting in more static pages and fewer JavaScript-related bugs.  
- **Automatic SSL**: SSL certificates are now generated automatically when HTTPS is requested for a domain. There's no need to manually generate and reload configurations.  
- **Rootless Docker**: Each superuser runs their own isolated Docker container, preventing cross-container access via local Docker networks.  
- **Support for Java and Ruby**: The autoinstaller now supports setting up Ruby and Java applications.  
- **Domain Suspension**: Users can now suspend website access as needed.  
- **Coraza WAF**: ModSecurity has been replaced with the more modern Coraza Web Application Firewall (WAF).  
- **Caddy Web Server**: Nginx has been replaced with Caddy as the default web server.  
- **Docker Contexts**: Each user gets their own Docker context, allowing multi-server user management.  
- **Python 3.12 for User Panel**: The control panel is now built on Python 3.12, and the Docker image tag will reflect the panel version.  
- **LiteSpeed Support**: LiteSpeed is now supported - looking for maintainers!
- **No Storage Files**: User quotas can now be increased or decreased dynamically, eliminating the need to create and mount storage files.  
- **Install and Update from GitHub**: OpenPanel installation and updates are now hosted and downloaded directly from GitHub.
