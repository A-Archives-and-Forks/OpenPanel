### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bug with [edit button on OpenPanel > Websites not fetching data from the database](https://i.postimg.cc/mRVC7hGr/2024-09-13-10-07.png).
- Fixed bug with remote access to MariaDB databases failing due to defaults defined in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf`.
- Fixed bug [Failed to create user: /bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: ")" unexpected #96](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel/issues/96).


### 💅 Polish
- Support for [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000) and [HTTP/3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114) - automatically enabled for new domains that use SSL.
- FTP sub-accounts are now restricted to their designated directories and are in the same group as OpenPanel user, allowing them to access and edit files without issues.
- Added browser validation and password generation to [OpenPanel > FTP Accounts > Change password](https://i.postimg.cc/NjGsNdRJ/2024-09-13-07-40.png) form.
- DNS zone edits will now [verify the serial number on each save](https://i.postimg.cc/s2h5Xf1Z/2024-09-13-08-26.png). If the zone has been modified by another user or program in the meantime, editing records will be disabled to ensure safety.
- WordPress AutoInstaller will no longer remove archives after extraction, instead keep and reuse them for future installations.
- phpMyAdmin is now accessible via both the domain name and the server's IP address. Users can enable /phpmyadmin on any domain by running the following command: `ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /home/USERNAME/DOMAIN/phpmyadmin`. When accessed through DOMAIN/phpmyadmin, a login form will appear, allowing the user to log in with any MySQL credentials. When accessed through IP:PORT via the OpenPanel interface, the user will be automatically logged in and granted access to all databases.
- [Symlinks are now supported in the FileManager](https://i.postimg.cc/QMjBRVtX/2024-09-13-13-59.png).
- Improvements to the 'OpenPanel > Services Status' page: view is changed from columns to table, and user will only view services that Administrator enabled in the enabled_modules.
