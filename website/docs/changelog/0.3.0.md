- DNS zone edits will now [verify the serial number on each save](https://i.postimg.cc/s2h5Xf1Z/2024-09-13-08-26.png). If the zone has been modified by another user or program in the meantime, editing records will be disabled to ensure safety.

When accessed through IP:PORT via the OpenPanel interface, the user will be automatically logged in and granted access to all databases.

- On OpenAdmin interface, all hardcoded links are now replaced with [Flask static files](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/static/) so that custom static folder can be defined in the future versions.
