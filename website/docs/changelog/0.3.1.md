- [Added checks to the install script: if admin account is actually created and docker file mounted](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel/commit/b1ee609d0723447fccbd090d83f198949008fb42).
- For new domains, the server signature is now passed from the web server running within the user's container. For users running Apache, the headers will display Apache, and for those running Nginx, the headers will display Nginx.
- As from 0.2.9 users can enable /phpmyadmin on a per-domain base, therefor global setting is removed from /etc/openpanel/openpanel/conf/openpanel.config file and `opencli phpmyadmin` command is removed.
- `opencli webserver-check_if_file_exists` command is removed.
- `opencli backup-run` will now check mysql status inside user container before trying to export databases and users.
- `/backup_info/<username>` route on OpenAdmin is now renamed to `/backups/restore/dates/<username>`.
