# 1.1.2

Not yet released

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- warning *quotacheck: Your kernel probably supports ext4 quota feature but you are using external quota files. Please switch your filesystem to use ext4 quota feature as external quota files on ext4 are deprecated.* is no longer displayed when creating users.
- warning *WARNING: Insufficient disk space on the server.* is no longer displayed when creating users.

### 💅 Polish
- Adding domains is now quicker as containers are started in the background.
- User creation is faster thanks to the reuse of the docker-compose plugin and the docker-rootless-setup.sh script, eliminating the need to download them each time. This not only saves time but also approximately 70MB of disk space per user.
- caching is added to all openpanel UI routes.
- `services` module is renamed to `info`
- `/server/services` page is deprecated and remove from sidebar and dashboard pages.
