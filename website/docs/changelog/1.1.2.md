# 1.1.2

Released on March 09, 2025

Note: This release was expedited to address critical bug fixes related to password resets, user creation, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- warning *quotacheck: Your kernel probably supports ext4 quota feature but you are using external quota files. Please switch your filesystem to use ext4 quota feature as external quota files on ext4 are deprecated.* is no longer displayed when creating users.
- warning *WARNING: Insufficient disk space on the server.* is no longer displayed when creating users.
- warning */bin/bash: line 41: warning: here-document at line 21 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `EOF')* is no longer displayed when creating users.
- message *Connection to the local host terminated.*  is no longer displayed when creating users.
- fixed bug with `opencli user-resources` script causing cpu/ram limits not to save on OpenPanel UI > Containers page.
- fixed a bug where the 2FA `otp_secret` code was not being saved in the database, preventing users with 2FA enabled from logging in.

### 💅 Polish
- Adding domains is now quicker as containers are started in the background.
- User creation is faster thanks to the reuse of the docker-compose plugin and the docker-rootless-setup.sh script, eliminating the need to download them each time. This not only saves time but also approximately 70MB of disk space per user.
- caching is added to all openpanel UI routes.
- `services` module is renamed to `info`
- `/server/services` page is deprecated and remove from sidebar and dashboard pages.
- `user_service` (ubuntu container) is no longer started when user is created.
- New command: [opencli dev](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/dev.html)
- New command: [opencli docker](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/docker.html)
- Time in the OpenPanel UI container will now reflect timezone setting from OpenAdmin (system OS time).
