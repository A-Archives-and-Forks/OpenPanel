OpenPanel 0.2.0 supports Debian ðŸš€

<!--truncate-->

Ever since our launch in late February, I've received questions like: "Why Ubuntu and not Debian?" The truth is, I'm more accustomed to Ubuntu, and haven't worked extensively with Debian to feel as comfortable managing and maintaining it as I do with Ubuntu.

However, with the overwhelming demand from our users on GitHub, forums, and Discord to add Debian support, I've accepted the challenge and began working on the integration.

After a few months of development and some adjustments to our existing logic, I'm thrilled to announce that OpenPanel 0.2.0 now fully supports Debian! ðŸŽ‰

We will support all current LTS versions of Debian, at this moment those are Debian11 and Debian12:

While there are still a few minor issues remainingâ€”ones that 99.9% of users will likely never encounterâ€”I'm committed to resolving them as swiftly as possible.

**Bugs on debian:**
- ~Pyarmor decoding fails for a specific python version: 3.11~ - Fixed in 0.2.0
- phpMyAdmin version in docker images is not compatible with PHP 8.2+

Please [give it a try](https://openpanel.co/install) and don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any bugs. Your feedback is invaluable in improving OpenPanel!

**Note:** As OpenPanel 0.2.0 is the first version to support Debian, attempting to install older versions of OpenPanel on Debian, such as `--version=0.1.8`, will fail.
