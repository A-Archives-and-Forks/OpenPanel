We are looking for maintainers!

<!--truncate-->

OpenPanel was built using open-source software, and while we haven't fully open-sourced all our code yet, we remain committed to supporting and loving open-source projects.

OpenPanel is an ambitious project that has taken years to develop and has yet to reach the scale we envision. There's still room for improvement, and we have big plans for the future. Check [our roadmap](https://openpanel.co/roadmap) to see where we're headed.

## We need Help!

If you have the time and are willing to support the project, you can help by:

- [QA testing upcoming versions before release](https://openpanel.co/docs/changelog/intro/)
- [Keeping the documentation up-to-date](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel/tree/main/documentation/docs)
- [Translating OpenPanel into your locale](https://dev.openpanel.co/localization.html)
- [Designing custom templates for OpenPanel](https://dev.openpanel.co/templates/create.html)
- [Building custom modules for OpenPanel](https://dev.openpanel.co/modules/) and [OpenAdmin](https://dev.openpanel.co/extensions/)

If anything of the above sound interesting to you, please message me.

## Giving back to Community

Here are some notable open-source projects that have emerged from the OpenPanel project:

- [**OpenVolume**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenVolume): The first Docker volume plugin that supports volume resizing.
- [**OpenMail**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenMail): A Dockerized mail server with webmail.
- [**OpenPanel FTP**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/OpenPanel-FTP): A Dockerized VSFTPD server.
- [**OpenBlacklist**](https://api.openpanel.co/blocklist.txt): A real-time blacklist for OpenPanel.
- [**IPset Blacklist**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/ipset-blacklist): Extend UFW with blacklists
- [**IPset Cloudflare**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/ipset-cloudflare): Restict access to Cloudflare IPs only
- [**Flask-UFW**](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/Flask-UFW): A Flask app for managing Uncomplicated Firewall.

These projects alone are ambitious, and I cannot maintain them by myself, so I am looking for maintainers!

If you are a fellow developer and would like to help maintain the OpenPanel project, please message me on [discord](https://discord.openpanel.co).
