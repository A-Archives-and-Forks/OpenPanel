OpenPanel BETA version is released! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ 

<!--truncate-->

We just released a public beta of the [0.1.5](https://openpanel.co/docs/changelog/0.1/#015) version

We invite you to try it and share your feedback with us.

Our [live demos](https://openpanel.co/demo) are refreshed every hour, and [the installation script](https://openpanel.co/docs/admin/intro/#installation) is compatible with Ubuntu 22.

We welcome any feedback on [our forums](https://community.openpanel.co/), as it will assist in better understanding the needs of different hosting providers and shaping the future of the product.

Thank you for your time.
