# How to Setup Django on OpenPanel

OpenPanel features a custom AutoInstaller that provides one-click installations for a variety of popular CMS and frameworks. Unlike other autoinstallers that primarily support PHP-based applications, OpenPanel's AutoInstaller also supports Python, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js applications.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to installing a Python-based application like Django on OpenPanel:

### Step 1: Create a Domain

Navigate to **OpenPanel > Domains** to add the domain name you will use for your app.
Ensure the domain name is pointed to the server's IP address, which you can find on the Dashboard page. Verify that you can access the domain.

###Step 2: Install Django Using AutoInstaller

In the OpenPanel menu, click on **Auto Installer** and select **Install** under the **NodeJS & Python** section.

In the form, choose your domain name under Application URL.

In the Application Startup File field, enter domainname/manage.py (replace domainname with your actual domain name).

SLIKA

In the Optional flags section, set the Django runserver command as follows: runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 (replace 8000 with your desired port number).

SLIKA

For the Type field, select Python, and in the Port field, enter the same port number you used in the runserver flag (e.g., 8000).

SLIKA

Click Create and wait a few minutes for the process to complete.

Note: The initial setup might be slow as it installs PM2, Python, Django admin, and other dependencies. Subsequent application setups will be faster.



### Step 3. Test in browser

Once the installation is complete, open your domain in a web browser to test the setup.
