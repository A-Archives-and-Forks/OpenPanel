# API

:::danger
THIS FEATURE IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT YET PRODUCTION READY!
:::

On *OpenAdmin > API* you can generate a JWT token and then make some API calls for testing to familiarize yourself with the API.

Below each command, you'll find the corresponding curl command, which you can copy and paste onto another server to execute the API call, along with the actual response returned by the API endpoint.

At the bottom, there's a section where you can view the API log, which records every request and response made to the API.
