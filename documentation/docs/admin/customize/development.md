# Development

Welcome to the Development section of OpenPanel, where developers can dive into extending the capabilities of our platform. OpenPanel is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to enhance its functionality and tailor it to your specific needs.

## Building Custom Modules

Developers have the opportunity to create custom modules that seamlessly integrate with OpenPanel. These modules can introduce new features, extend existing functionalities, and adapt the platform to unique use cases. 

Stay tuned for the upcoming addition of our Module Development Guide, providing a comprehensive walkthrough on creating and seamlessly integrating custom modules into OpenPanel. Exciting developments are on the horizon as we enhance our resources to empower developers in shaping the future of OpenPanel.



## Running Custom Code

### Run custom code on OpenPanel installation

To execute custom code following the installation of OpenPanel, place your custom script on the server. When initiating the OpenPanel installation process, use the `--post_install=` flag and specify the path to your script within it.
Example:

```bash
 --post_install=/root/my_custom_script.sh
```
