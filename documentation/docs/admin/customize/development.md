## Running Custom Code

### Run custom code on OpenPanel installation

To execute custom code following the installation of OpenPanel, place your custom script on the server. When initiating the OpenPanel installation process, use the `--post_install=` flag and specify the path to your script within it.
Example:

```bash
 --post_install=/root/my_custom_script.sh
```
