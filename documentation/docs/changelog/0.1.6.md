:::danger
API access is automatically disabled when BasicAuth is enabled.

##### Custom Templates for OpenAdmin and OpenPanel

Starting v0.1.6 you can set [custom templates](https://dev.openpanel.co/templates/) for both OpenPanel and OpenAdmin interfaces!

Examples:

![example](https://i.postimg.cc/QMtPQHcj/2024-04-05-16-59.png)

To create new templates copy the default templates folders:

For OpenPanel: `cp /usr/local/panel/templates/ /home/custom_template/`

For OpenAdmin: `cp /usr/local/admin/templates/ /home/custom_admin_template/`

and then make the changes over html/css file.

To change theme for OpenPanel, run command:

```
opencli config update template NAME_HERE
```

instead of *NAME_HERE* set either just the folder name in `/usr/local/panel/` or a full path, example:

```
opencli config update template "/home/custom_template/"
```

To change theme for OpenAdmin, run command:

```
opencli config update admin_template NAME_HERE
```

instead of *NAME_HERE* set either just the folder name in `/usr/local/admin/` or a full path, example:

```
opencli config update admin_template "/home/custom_admin_template/"
```

##### Turkish translation for OpenPanel

Turkish language is now available for OpenPanel! 🎉

It will be included in the [0.1.6 version](https://openpanel.co/roadmap) and shipped with OpenPanel core.

Thank you **grafen** for your personal contribution to OpenPanel. 🙏

To use `tr` locale immediately, run command:

```
wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stefanpejcic/701fe98ab873120378f7c7de9d75e030/raw/0d4db8338ce2ad17aec54dfc1d4982abdbb254dc/install_tr.sh | bash

##### Panel update from GUI

OpenPanel can now be udpated directly form the OpenAdmin interface.

To update navigate to *OpenAdmin > General Settings* section and if new update is available, click on the update button to initiate.

##### /etc/cron.d/openpanel

OpenPanel now utilizes a custom cron file located at `/etc/cron.d/openpanel` instead of relying on the root user's crontab. This allows the root user to add custom cronjobs without the risk of them being overwritten during OpenPanel updates.
