## Fixed bug durring ModSecurity installation process

As (reported by [reyokh](https://hostingforums.net/d/282-openpanel-not-another-free-hosting-panel/6)) - the installation of ModSecurity via the OpenAdmin interface failed to complete. We added additional checks and rewrote the script in order to make it work more efficiatenlty.

Tested on dozen new installs and now working without a problem.
