## Fixed bug durring ModSecurity installation process

As (reported by [reyokh](https://hostingforums.net/d/282-openpanel-not-another-free-hosting-panel/6)) - the installation of ModSecurity via the OpenAdmin interface failed to complete. To address this issue, we implemented extra validations and updated the script for enhanced efficiency. After conducting tests on a dozen new installations, we can confirm the solution is working.
