- Fixed bug within dockerfile for `openpanel/nginx-mariadb:latest` image that caused failed build step.
- Fixed bug with limiting port speed on AlmaLinux, due to the tc command missing.

### 💅 Polish
- Administrators can now specify the PHP extensions to be installed automatically when a user installs a PHP version by editing [the `/etc/openpanel/php/extensions.txt` file](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/openpanel-configuration/blob/main/php/extensions.txt).
- Administrators can now specify the PHP.INI values to be automatically set when a user installs a PHP version by editing the [`/etc/openpanel/php/ini.txt` file](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/openpanel-configuration/blob/main/php/ini.txt).
- `opencli ssl-domain` will now first try to generate certificate with DNS-01 verification, if that fails, HTTP-01 will be used.
- Wildcard subdomain SSL are now generated automatically if domain is pointed with nameservers to the OpenPanel server.
- Update script will now [create a log file of each update attempt and write a notification in OpenAdmin dashboard](https://i.postimg.cc/sXvkNFKv/2024-08-30-20-33.png).
- Added timeouts to all external curl and wget calls from opencli scripts.
- `opencli ssl-domain` command now accepts optional flag `--dry-run` to perform a test run against the Let's Encrypt staging server, obtaining test (invalid) certificates but not saving them to disk.
- Improved [opencli files-fix_permissions](https://dev.openpanel.com/cli/files.html#Fix-Permissions) script will now add permissions for groups as well and run commands in parallel to speed-up the process.
- `bash` is replaced with `sh` in all opencli scripts, so we have support for alpine containers.
- `bc` command is repalced with `awk` in sentinel scripts, so we have support for RHEL distributions that do not have bc pre-installed.
- The admin user impersonating OpenPanel users now has a distinct indicator bar and lacks a logout option, as ending the user session would also log the admin out of the panel.
- All  of our hosted services are migrated from .co to .com domain.
- `opencli ssl-domain` command now accepts optional flag `--debug` to output  verbose inforamtion.
- Disk Usage widget on OpenAdmin > Dashboard now displays types.
