### OpenPanel Blacklist

OpenPanel Blacklist shows top 10000 IP addresses that are currently involved *(in last 12hr) with attacks to OpenPanel servers.

The list is auto-generated from the data collected by Sentinel service. Data is checked against other blacklists in order to avoid any false-positives and provide always up-to-date information.

URL: https://api.openpanel.co/blocklist.txt

![openpanel blacklist](https://i.postimg.cc/N0QncRRt/2024-06-08-13-45.png)

Starting OpenPanel 0.2.1 this blacklist will be enabled by default in [IPset Blacklists](/docs/changelog/0.1.9/#ipset-blacklists).


### PHP extensions

Additional php extensions are now installed for every PHP version.

New extensions:
- xdebug
- apcu
- imap
- pgsql
- odbc
- dba
- enchant
- gmp
- snmp
- soap
- pspell
- recode
- gettext
- sybase
- shmop
- sysvmsg
- sysvsem
- sysvshm
- tokenizer
- wddx
- xsl
- interbase
- mcrypt
- mysqli
- pdo
- pdo_dblib
- pdo_firebird
- pdo_mysql
- pdo_odbc
- pdo_pgsql
- pdo_sqlite
- phalcon
- radius
- readline
- reflection
- session
- simplexml
- sodium
- solr
- sqlite3

- sysvshm
- tcpdf
- tidy
- uploadprogress
- uuid
- wddx
- xcache
- xdebug
- xmlreader
- xmlwriter
- yaml
- zip
- zlib

Due to the higher number of extensions, we are also changing the install method to run in parallel. This may result in incosistent logs for php version install, but will speed up the install up to 4x.

### PHPMyAdmin Proxy

OpenPanel users can now access their PHPMyAdmin instances using https://their-domain/com`/phpmyadmin`. Auto-login from OpenPanel is still available, but if accessed via *https://their-domain/com/phpmyadmin/* then they can login as any mysql user and access the databases that user has access. This allows users to securely share limited phpmyadmin access with third parties.

### Translations

Starting version 0.2.1 the path for OpenPanel translations is changed from `/usr/local/panel/translations/` to `/etc/openpanel/openpanel/translations/`. This will ensure that translation files are not modified during OpenPanel updates, ensuring that you never lose your local changes.

We have also created a new command to help you easily install any locale(s):

- List all available locales:
  ```bash
  opencli locale
  ```
- Installing single locale:
  ```bash
  opencli locale sr-sr
  ```
- Installing multiple locales at once:
  ```bash
  opencli locale sr-sr tr-tr
  ```

### Firewall Settings

*OpenAdmin > Frewall > Settings* page displays current firewall status, allows you to enable/disable firewall, edit settings, export existing rules or reset rules for all users.

![firewall-settings](https://i.postimg.cc/NFGZm1Lx/2024-06-11-12-25.png)

- **IPv6** options allows you to enable or disable IPv6 rules. When disabled, the IPv6 ports tab is hidden.
- **Default Input Policy** allows you to set DROP or ACCEPT incoming connections to ports that are not specified in the rules.
- **Default Output Policy** allows you to set DROP or ACCEPT outgoing connections from ports that are not specified in the rules.
- **Allow ping (IPMI)** allows you to enable or disable ping.
- **Export IPv4 rules** will download in txt file all existing ipv4 rules.
- **Export IPv6 rules** will download in txt file all existing ipv6 rules.
- **Reset ports for all users** will delete opened ports for all users and open the current ports for all active users.
- **Restrict access to Cloudflare only** - will whitelist all Cloudfalre proxy IP addresses.

### notifications check
`opencli admin notifications check` command allows administrators to check notifications manually from the terminal.

Example output:

### CSF

ConfigServer Firewall can now be used with OpenPanel. To switch to CSF:
1. Uninstall UFW
2. Install CSF
3. Run `opencli firewall-reset` 

This will open needed ports and edit csf.conf to allow docker networks to communicate to the host.

Please note that currently there is no interface in OpenAdmin to manage the CSF, so all changes need to be made [from the terminal](https://pcx3.com/cheatsheets/csf/) or by using [CSF UI](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-enable-csf-firewall-web-ui/).

### Custom CSS

Administrators can add custom CSS code in `/usr/local/admin/static/custom/custom.css` file.
