# 0.1.8

Not yet released.


### 🚀 New features


### 🐛 Bug fixes
- "New User" button on 'OpenAdmin > Users' is now visible on mobile devices.
- Resolved issue regarding locales not being installed during OpenPanel installation.


### 💅 Polish
- `opencli ssl-hostname` script now tries to restart all required services if any are failed.
- MySQL docker container now automatically restarts after failure.
- [GoAccess is now run as docker container to process domain logs](#allinurl-goaccess)


### allinurl/goaccess

GoAccess is no longer directly installed on the server; instead, it [runs as a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/allinurl/goaccess) when necessary. This setup ensures that resources are utilized only when required and prevents any utilization of system services during idle periods. When collecting domain statistics, one container is initiated per domain name.
