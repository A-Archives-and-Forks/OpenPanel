### allinurl/goaccess

GoAccess is no longer directly installed on the server; instead, it [runs as a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/allinurl/goaccess) when necessary. This setup ensures that resources are utilized only when required and prevents any utilization of system services during idle periods. When collecting domain statistics, one container is initiated per domain name.
