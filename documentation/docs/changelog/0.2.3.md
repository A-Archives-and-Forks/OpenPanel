# 0.2.3

Not yet released.


### 🚀 New feature
- [Upload file from URL using File Manager](#upload-url)

### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bug with cron file causing daily reports not being sent from OpenAdmin.
- Fixed bug with `opencli websites-pagespeed --all` failing to generate reports for all websites.
- Fixed bug with `/json/page_speed/` route not accepting websites in subfolders.



### 💅 Polish

- Nginx and Apache vhosts files now restrict access to sensitive resources by default, these include: `.git`, `compose.json`, `composer.lock`, `auth.json`, `config.php`, `wp-config.php`, `vendor`. OpenPanel users can edit and remove the rules for any domain, from the **OpenPanel > Domains > Edit Vhosts File** page.



### Upload URL

In **OpenPanel > File Manager**, click on "Upload." In the modal, select "Download from URL," then add the link and click the "Download" button.

This feature accepts any link type. If the link points to an archive *(`.zip`, `.tgz`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar`, `.gz`), it will automatically be extracted; if it's a regular file, it will simply be downloaded.
