# 0.2.3

Not yet released.




### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bug with cron file causing daily reports not being sent from OpenAdmin.



### 💅 Polish

- Nginx and Apache vhosts files now restrict access to sensitive resources by default, these include: `.git`, `compose.json`, `composer.lock`, `auth.json`, `config.php`, `wp-config.php`, `vendor`. OpenPanel users can edit and remove the rules for any domain, from the **OpenPanel > Domains > Edit Vhosts File** page.
