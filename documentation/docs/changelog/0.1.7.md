### Skip version

Administrators now have the ability to specify which OpenPanel versions to skip during updates by modifying the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file.

This feature proves handy when manually updating from an older version and wishing to skip certain intermediate versions.

For instance, if a user is updating from OpenPanel 0.1.3 with autopatches disabled, the update process would typically progress from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5, then to 0.1.6, and finally to the latest version, 0.1.7.

However, if there are minimal differences between versions 0.1.4 and 0.1.5, an admin can opt to skip version 0.1.4 by appending it to the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file:

```bash
echo 0.1.4 >> /etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions
```

Consequently, during the update procedure, specified version 0.1.4 will be skipped.

It's worth noting that while skipping versions is possible, it's generally not recommended since each update typically takes around 30 seconds.


In the event of a failed update to a particular version, the opencli update scripts will automatically add that version to the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file to prevent future attempts at updating to it.

----

### Forbidden Username

Both `opencli user-add` and `opencli user-rename` scripts now use an external list of forbidden names from: `/usr/local/admin/scripts/helpers/forbidden_usernames.txt` file. Administrators can add usernames to this list.

```bash
test
restart
reboot
shutdown
exec
root
admin
ftp
lsws
litespeed
1000
vsftpd
apache2
apache
nginx
php
mysql
mysqld
www-data
openpanel
```

----

### SSH after reboot

SSH service inside users docker containers is disabled by defult when account is created, and in OpenPanel < 0.1.6 was also disabled by defualt when server is rebooted.

We now store the ssh service status for each user and if enabled, after reboot will be re-enabled. note: ssh service for users uses a random port, so after reboot the port is changed.


----

### hub.docker.com

OpenPanel official docker images are now hosted on hub.docker.com

- Nginx stack: https://hub.docker.com/r/openpanel/nginx/tags
- Apache stack: https://hub.docker.com/r/openpanel/apache/tags



-----

### Disabled services

In order to reduce the memory footprint of Docker containers, we are implementing breaking changes to our official Docker images for Nginx and Apache:

- NodeJS, Python, PM2, and WP-CLI are removed from the images. They are installed only when needed: when a user adds a WordPress website or a Node.js/Python application.
- All services are disabled by default and will only be enabled when needed. MySQL is enabled when adding the first database or user, webservers are started only when a domain is added, SSH only when SSH access is enabled, cron service after cronjob is added, etc.

This ensures that only the services that are actually used are running.

With these changes, **we managed to lower idle CPU & Memory Usage of new user accounts from 680MB to less than 10MB**.

### Ubuntu24 images

Both official images [openpanel/nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpanel/nginx) and [openpanel/apache](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpanel/apache) now use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base images.
This change fixes 16 vulnerabilities in the previous Ubuntu 22.04 docker image
