### Skip version

Administrators now have the ability to specify which OpenPanel versions to skip during updates by modifying the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file.

This feature proves handy when manually updating from an older version and wishing to skip certain intermediate versions.

For instance, if a user is updating from OpenPanel 0.1.3 with autopatches disabled, the update process would typically progress from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5, then to 0.1.6, and finally to the latest version, 0.1.7.

However, if there are minimal differences between versions 0.1.4 and 0.1.5, an admin can opt to skip version 0.1.4 by appending it to the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file:

```bash
echo 0.1.4 >> /etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions
```

Consequently, during the update procedure, specified version 0.1.4 will be skipped.

It's worth noting that while skipping versions is possible, it's generally not recommended since each update typically takes around 30 seconds.


In the event of a failed update to a particular version, the opencli update scripts will automatically add that version to the `/etc/openpanel/upgrade/skip_versions` file to prevent future attempts at updating to it.

### SSH after reboot

SSH service inside users docker containers is disabled by defult when account is created, and in OpenPanel < 0.1.6 was also disabled by defualt when server is rebooted.

We now store the ssh service status for each user and if enabled, after reboot will be re-enabled. note: ssh service for users uses a random port, so after reboot the port is changed.
