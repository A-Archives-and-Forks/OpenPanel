# 0.2.2

Not yet released.



### 🚀 New features
- Google PageSpeed data for WordPress websites on [OpenPanel WPManager](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress/).

- Widgets on [OpenAdmin Dashboard](/docs/admin/dashboard/): *Usage*, *Quick Start*, *Latest News* and *CPU* can now be dismissed.


### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bugs on *OpenAdmin > Users > Profile* and *OpenPanel > Dashboard* with disk usage information not displayed when overlay2 storage driver is used.


### phpMyAdmin

Added an option to run a shared phpMyAdmin service accessible on a custom domain, allowing login for all MySQL users of OpenPanel. This service contradicts OpenPanel's usual setup where each user has independent services, but it was requested by a few users, so we decided to implement it. It remains disabled by default.

To enable the shared phpMyAdmin service, first set the URL where it will be accessible. For example:

```bash
opencli config update pma_url https://phpmyadmin.pejcic.rs
```

Then enable the phpMyAdmin service for all users:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --enable
```

This will start the phpMyAdmin service, configure an nginx reverse proxy for the domain, and generate an SSL certificate if using HTTPS.

To disable the service:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --disable
```

If enabled, the auto-login option from OpenPanel will no longer work. Instead, each user must use a username and password to log in to phpMyAdmin.

NOTE: OpenPanel user must enable RemoteMySQL for his mysql users to be able to use the phpMyAdmin service.


If this shared service is enabled, we recommend removing phpmyadmin from the Dockerfiles and rebuilding the images. This will save you up to 250MB per OpenPanel user.
