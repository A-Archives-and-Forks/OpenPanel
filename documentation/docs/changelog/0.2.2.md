- [Containerized Nginx webserver](#nginx)
- Google PageSpeed data for WordPress websites on [OpenPanel WPManager](/docs/panel/applications/wordpress/).
- Option to clear cached RAM from [OpenAdmin Dashboard](/docs/admin/dashboard/) page.
- [Shared phpMyAdmin for All OpenPanel users and their MySQL users](#phpmyadmin)

### 🐛 Bug fixes
- Fixed bugs on *OpenAdmin > Users > Profile* and *OpenPanel > Dashboard* with disk usage information not displayed when overlay2 storage driver is used.
- Fixed bug with File Watcher service causing infinite OpenAdmin service restart on Ubuntu24.
- Fixed bug with OpenAdmin > Firewall > Blacklists (IPsets) causing `ufw reload` command to fail - reported by [@f1lk3](https://github.com/f1lk3).
- Fixed bug with `opencli config update` command not restarting OpenPanel docker container *(introduced in OpenPanel 0.2.1).


### Nginx

Nginx is now no longer installed on the server, but instead runs as a Docker container. A custom Docker image with Nginx, ModSecurity, and the latest OWASP Core Rule Set is used.

This approach has several benefits:

- **ModSecurity Pre-installed**: In OpenPanel <0.2.2, ModSecurity is not pre-installed because installing it requires compiling Nginx from source, which takes 15-20 minutes. Previously, admins had the option to install ModSecurity if desired. Now, ModSecurity comes pre-installed with Nginx, and the entire stack (Nginx, ModSecurity, OWASP ruleset, and Certbot) takes less than 1 minute to start.
- **Automatic Nginx Updates**: Since we use a custom image to bundle the latest Nginx version, OWASP rules, and ModSecurity, we can now update the image on our side when newer versions are available. Your OpenPanel server will automatically use the newest Ngincx version.
- **Automatic Rules Update**: We will also automatically update the rules, ensuring that your server always has the latest security rules. Custom settings and disable per domain or rule will still be respected.
- **Resource Limiting**: You can now define CPU and memory limits for the Nginx service. This means that if there is a DoS attack on some of the domains, the server and other services will remain functional.



### DNSSEC

New command `opencli domains-dnssec` is available and allows administrators to enable DNSSEC, re-sign the zone and view DS records for domains.

- to enable dnssec for example.net :
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com
  ```

- to update the zone after publishing new records:
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com --update
  ```

- to check if domain has dnssec enabled and view DS records:
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com --check
  ```

Please note that this feature is still experimental and there is still no UI for it in OpenPanel interface.

### phpMyAdmin

Added an option to run a shared phpMyAdmin service accessible on a custom domain, allowing login for all MySQL users of OpenPanel. This service contradicts OpenPanel's usual setup where each user has independent services, but it was requested by a few users, so we decided to implement it. It remains disabled by default.

To enable the shared phpMyAdmin service, first set the URL where it will be accessible. For example:

```bash
opencli config update pma_url https://phpmyadmin.pejcic.rs
```

Then enable the phpMyAdmin service for all users:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --enable
```

This will start the phpMyAdmin service, configure an nginx reverse proxy for the domain, and generate an SSL certificate if using HTTPS.

To disable the service:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --disable
```

If enabled, the auto-login option from OpenPanel will no longer work. Instead, each user must use a username and password to log in to phpMyAdmin.

NOTE: OpenPanel user must enable RemoteMySQL for his mysql users to be able to use the phpMyAdmin service.


If this shared service is enabled, we recommend removing phpmyadmin from the Dockerfiles and rebuilding the images. This will save you up to 250MB per OpenPanel user.
