### OpenCLI Help

[OpenCLI](https://dev.openpanel.co/cli/) now keeps history of used commands and allows you to view last and top 5 used commands:
```
# opencli

Usage: opencli <COMMAND> [additional_arguments]

Suggested commands:
  opencli faq                       Display frequently asked questions and answers.
  opencli commands                  List all available OpenCLI commands and their usage.

Recently used commands:
  opencli docker-collect_stats
  opencli faq
  opencli update
  opencli update_check
  opencli user-add

Most commonly used commands:
  opencli admin
  opencli docker-collect_stats

### DNSSEC

New command `opencli domains-dnssec` is available and allows administrators to enable DNSSEC, re-sign the zone and view DS records for domains.

- to enable dnssec for example.net :
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com
  ```

- to update the zone after publishing new records:
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com --update
  ```

- to check if domain has dnssec enabled and view DS records:
  ```
  opencli domains-dnssec example.com --check
  ```

Please note that this feature is still experimental and there is still no UI for it in OpenPanel interface.

### phpMyAdmin

Added an option to run a shared phpMyAdmin service accessible on a custom domain, allowing login for all MySQL users of OpenPanel. This service contradicts OpenPanel's usual setup where each user has independent services, but it was requested by a few users, so we decided to implement it. It remains disabled by default.

To enable the shared phpMyAdmin service, first set the URL where it will be accessible. For example:

```bash
opencli config update pma_url https://phpmyadmin.pejcic.rs
```

Then enable the phpMyAdmin service for all users:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --enable
```

This will start the phpMyAdmin service, configure an nginx reverse proxy for the domain, and generate an SSL certificate if using HTTPS.

To disable the service:

```bash
opencli phpmyadmin --disable
```

If enabled, the auto-login option from OpenPanel will no longer work. Instead, each user must use a username and password to log in to phpMyAdmin.

NOTE: OpenPanel user must enable RemoteMySQL for his mysql users to be able to use the phpMyAdmin service.


If this shared service is enabled, we recommend removing phpmyadmin from the Dockerfiles and rebuilding the images. This will save you up to 250MB per OpenPanel user.
