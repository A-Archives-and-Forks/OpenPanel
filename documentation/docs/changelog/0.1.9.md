## IPset Blacklists

OpenAdmin Firewall now allows Administrators to add blacklists and block all IP addresses from them. 

This feature uses [ipset-blacklist service](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/ipset-blacklist) to automatically fetch ip addresses from configured blacklists and modify UFW.

New opencli commands are also available:

- Download new IP addresses for all enabled blocklists:
  ```bash
  opencli blacklist --fetch
  ```
- Update all ipsets rules and reload UFW service:
  ```bash
  bash /usr/ipset-blacklist.sh --update_ufw
  ```
- Add a new blacklist:
  ```bash
  bash /usr/ipset-blacklist.sh --add-blacklist name=<name> url=<url>
  ```
- Enable a blacklist:
  ```bash
  bash /usr/ipset-blacklist.sh --enable-blacklist=<name>
  ```
- Disable a blacklist:
  ```bash
  bash /usr/ipset-blacklist.sh --disable-blacklist=<name>
  ```

## `/etc/openpanel/`

To enable easier updates in the future, we are gradually migrating all configuration files from `/usr/local/panel/` & `/usr/local/admin/` directories to the new `/etc/openpanel/` directory.

This will separate configuration files  in /etc/ from all the code in /usr/ and therefore no configuration files will need to be moved&restored when performing updates.

Current changes include:

- Forbidden usernames file is now moved from: `/usr/local/admin/scripts/helpers/forbidden_usernames.txt` to `/etc/openpanel/openadmin/config/forbidden_usernames.txt`
- FTP configuration files are stored under `/etc/openpanel/ftp/users/`
