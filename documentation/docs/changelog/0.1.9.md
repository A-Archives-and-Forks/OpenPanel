## `/etc/openpanel/`

To enable easier updates in the future, we are gradually migrating all configuration files from `/usr/local/panel/` & `/usr/local/admin/` directories to the new `/etc/openpanel/` directory.

This will separate configuration files  in /etc/ from all the code in /usr/ and therefore no configuration files will need to be moved&restored when performing updates.

Current changes include:

- Forbidden usernames file is now moved from: `/usr/local/admin/scripts/helpers/forbidden_usernames.txt` to `/etc/openpanel/openadmin/config/forbidden_usernames.txt`
- FTP configuration files are stored under `/etc/openpanel/ftp/users/`
